**Project 1**:

- Jenny Le

**Objective**: Develop a Java-based e-commerce platform that mirrors some of the key functionalities of Amazon. A GUI
will be rendered for local execution.

**Assumptions**: Users possess basic e-commerce platform knowledge and the ability to navigate shopping interfaces.

**Operating Environments**: Any operating system that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Intended Usage**: Serve as a proof of concept that an e-commerce platform can be replicated in a local environment
using Java.

**High-Level Description**: To develop the Java-based e-commerce platform, we will map out the core features found in
e-commerce platforms, such as product listings and user management. These features will have to be developed in a way
such that they can interact seamlessly to provide the best user experience.

## Features:

- Browse through a wide range of products and their details
- Registration and profile viewing for buyers and sellers
- Buyer Shopping Cart and Checkout
- Use product filters to quickly search and narrow down the choices
- Sort the products by popularity, cost, and brand
